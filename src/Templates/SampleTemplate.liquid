Hello, {{name}}!

Today is {{HB_NowLocal | date: "dddd"}}, {{HB_NowLocal | date: "M"}}

Here we try to render some variable that doesn't exist: {{notDefinedVariable}} ~~

{% if notDefinedVariable %}
  You should NOT be able to see this string!!!!!
{% else %}
  You SHOULD be able to see this string!
{% endif %}

This string should be escaped for html: {{htmlToEscape | escape_once }}

HarmonyBadger offers the following template parameters by default:
  - HB_NowLocal -> {{HB_NowLocal}}
  - HB_NowUtc -> {{HB_NowUtc}}
  - HB_Environment -> {{HB_Environment}}
